Information/Questions
-----------------------

I'd call this a FAQ but this site has, at the time of writing, been live for 15 minutes
so no one has asked questions yet. I'm just going to put answers to questions I imagine
people might have.

  * **What is this?** an attempt to index P&S modcasts for easy access to information
  * **Why is this needed?** because there's lots of great information in these 2+ hour modcasts, but finding it is difficult.
  * **Why is this hosted on Github Pages?** because it's free and low-maintenance. I'm a software reverse engineer by trade, and web development bores and confuses me. I find front-end development and UX design especially tedious, and GitHub's markdown stuff handles all that for me.
  * **I could do this much better!** Cool! The JSON files are sitting there in the github repo. Take them and use them to make your own index. Seriously. That's why I put them there.
  * **How do I contribute an episode index?** Are you technically inclined? Clone this repository, create a JSON file describing the episode (use `126.json` as an example) and put it in the `modcasts` directory. Please name it `<episode_number>.json`. Open a pull request and I'll do the rest. If you're *not* technically inclined, get on the P&S Discord and send me a list of timestamps and descriptions. I'll put it into the right format.
