Modcast Index
======================

Hello, this is an index of Primary and Secondary modcast episodes.
There's lots of great information in P&S's modcasts, but since they're
2-5 hour youtube videos, it's hard to access and link to. We're trying
to fix that.

For information on how this was built, why it was built the way it was,
and how to contribute, click [here](info.md).
